  <h1>Reader Vault Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Last updated: February 17, 2026</p>
  <p>Reader Vault ("the app") lets you load text (from files, paste, or a URL), save books/guides for offline reading, track reading progress, and set word highlights. The content you save (text, titles, progress, and highlights) is stored locally on your device.</p>
  <p>The app may transmit data over the internet only when you use network features: (1) Load from URL: when you enter a URL, the app downloads that page's content to extract readable text; (2) Import/Export (backup link): when you generate a backup link, the app encrypts the backup on your device and uploads only the encrypted data to a third-party PrivateBin-compatible service; when you import, the app downloads the encrypted data and decryption happens on your device.</p>
  <p>Even though backup content is encrypted before upload, third-party services and network providers may receive standard technical connection data (for example IP address and connection metadata) as part of normal internet communication. The app does not require an account, does not sell data, and does not share your saved content with third parties except when you choose to use the network features described above. You can control your data by deleting guides within the app or uninstalling the app (which removes local data).</p>
  <p>If the app is obtained through the Microsoft Store, Microsoft may process data related to download/purchase/licensing under Microsoft's own policies; this policy describes only processing performed by the Reader Vault app.</p>
